# Notes - Resource Wall

An app for students to save learning resources in a central place that are available to any user. Users can search for resources (keyword, categories, average rating or content type). They can rate & like any resource. Using styling, a user can see if they have already liked/rated a resource.

A user can edit or delete resources they created, and view all their own and liked resources on the 'My Resources' page.
